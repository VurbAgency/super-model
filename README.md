# SuperModel

## The web-app

The SuperModel web app is a Polymer Starter Kit App, for how to develop this see [it's readme](https/README.md).

To localy serve use `firebase serve` in the command line.

To deploy, use `firebase deploy`

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the Firebase CLI, for the local server and deploying, and Polymer CLI, for tests, installed.

## Namespaces

When namespaces are needed it is Sum, short for SuperModel. So polymer elements are named `sum-something` and classes `SumSomething`.
